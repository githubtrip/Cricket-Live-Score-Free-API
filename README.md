Here i am to sharing the free cricket live score code which i have built in the PHP which return the result in the JSON 
format and also created the JSON file. You can simply execute the code on your server and hit the URL and get the outcome.

The following are the list whose code I am sharing.
1. Get All Players
2. Get All Series
3. Get All Matches.
4. Single Player Detail.
5. Match Schedule.

You can easily implement these API'S in you website/app.

Relying on a 3rd party (https://www.cricket.com.au) as a service API to pull data.

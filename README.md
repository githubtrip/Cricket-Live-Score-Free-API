Here i am to share the free cricket live score api, And also share the code which i have built in the PHP which return the record in the JSON 
format.

The following are the list whose code I am sharing.
1. Get All Players
2. Get All Series
3. Get All Matches.
4. Single Player Detail.
5. Match Schedule.

You can easily implement these API'S in you website/app.
Relying on a 3rd party (https://www.cricket.com.au) as a service API to pull data.
